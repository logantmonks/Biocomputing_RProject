# answer for Question 1
"My answer for Question 1 is that it must have begun in Country X. 
As seen in the ggplot graph of two lines, the first screen tests that were positive
were recorded in countryX. In addition, the numbers of infected at common dates are much higher
for country X than for country Y generally, indicating it may have had the outbreak going on for 
a longer time.

"My answer for Question 2 is yes vaccine developed in country Y would work for X,
because as we see in the simple tilemap, we see all markers present in X also in Y
infected patients. If the colors are different side by side for a marker, then
that means it is not a common marker between X and Y. However, we do see same colors
side by side for all markers in this graph. Given that the vaccine is developed based
on the country Y's markers 1 through 10 presence factor, yes the vaccine would also
work for those in X who have the same set of markers.
