#files.

#Write a function to compile data from all .csv files in a directory into a single .csv file. The compiled
#data should have the original twelve columns from daily data sheets, but also country and dayofYear
#columns. The user should be able to choose whether they want to remove rows with NAâ€™s in any
#columns, include NAs in the compiled data but be warned of their presence, or include NAs in the
#compiled data without a warning
