## Answer for Question 1: 

# To answer the question of where did the disease outbreak first occur we conducted an analysis
# of the distribution of infected by day of the year in each country. To achieve this goal,
# we calculated the number of infected individuals in each country and created a series of plots
# to evaluate the distribution of infected individuals compared to day of year.
# Figure 1 suggests that country X had more infected individuals in earlier days of the year
# compared to country Y. This can be seen as country X has a greater amount of light blue indicating infected
# in the lower half of the graph. Meanwhile, country Y has a greater amount of dark blue indicating non infected individuals
# in the lower half of the graph. The Figure 3 (histogram) also shows the same result. Country X (red) has more infected
# individuals in earlier days of the year (left portion of the histogram), meanwhile Country Y (blue) has very low numbers
# of infected individuals in the same period (left side of the histogram). The infected individual population of Country Y
# starts to increase around day 140.
# These observations support the conclusion that the disease originated in Country X were the infected individuals first appeared.



### Question 2: If Country Y develops a vaccine for the disease, is it likely to work for citizens of Country X?


# Join allData.csv with infected column:

# Subset allData by removing all ages greater than age 120:

# with ages like 423, 418,367 are not realistic. A total of 15 individuals are removed from the data.

## Answer for Question 2:

# To answer the question regarding the effectiveness of a vaccine developed in Country Y
# to combat the disease in Country X, we took into account some factors and conducted
# an analysis. The first factor we considered was the age distribution in each country because
# vaccine effectiveness, testing, and dosage may be different based on age group.
# Based on our analysis, both countries have very similar age distributions as seen in figures 4 and 5.
# This result does not provide sufficient evidence to reject the use of the vaccine in Country X.

# The second factor analyzed was the gender distribution of each country. This was evaluated
# because the physiology of females and males are different and may affect vaccine effectiveness. 
# Based on our analysis, both countries have very similar gender distributions as seen in figures 6 and 7.
# Based on this result, there is no sufficient evidence to reject the use of the vaccine in Country X.

# The third and final factor analyzed was the presence of each disease marker by country.
# We evaluated this because having different markers indicated changes in the protein of the bacteria
# that causes the disease which may suggest different strains of the disease and may cause issues with
# effectiveness of the vaccine. To analyze this factor, we calculated the percent of each marker
# in each country and created two bar plot (figure 8 & 9). Based on Fig. 8 & 9, we can observe that in
# Country X (Fig. 8) there is a greater presence of infected individuals with markers 1-5 and
# very low presence of infected individuals with markers 6-10. On the other hand, we can observe that in
# Country Y (Fig. 9) there is a greater presence of infected individuals with markers 6-10 and a lower presence 
# of individuals with markers 1-5. This results suggests that the disease in Country X may be a different strain
# that the one in Country Y. Therefore, a vaccine developed in Country Y may be less effective
# in combating the disease in Country X.

# In conclusion, despite both countries having very similar populations, the markers for the disease are
# very different between countries which may indicate different strains of the disease.
# Therefore, the vaccine developed in Country Y will not work on the citizens of Country X.
